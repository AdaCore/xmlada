New features in version 4.5
---------------------------

NF-45-N411-012 New subprograms Import_Node and Adopt_Node (2014-05-06)

   These subprograms, part of respectively DOM level 2 and DOM level 3,
   are now implemented, and can be used to move or copy one node from a
   tree to another. In addition, subprograms like Append_Child will now
   correctly complain when the new node was not created for the same tree.

NF-45-N324-002 New configure option --enable-build (2014-03-24)

   This switch improves compatibility with other AdaCore addons like GtkAda.
   It enables one to choose the default build mode (Debug or Production)
   at configure line, rather than through environment variables.
