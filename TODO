xml module:
============

* DOM requires Utf16-encoding for strings.
  Can we make all the packages generic, so that the user can decide whether
  to use Utf16 or Utf8 ?
* Should recognize the "encoding" attribute for <?xml?>

* Unicode: Add conversion to Wide_Char and Wide_String

* Support for xml:* attributes (space, lang, ...)
  Note that xml:space means that we must use the Ignorable_Whitespace callback
  in SAX.

* Should Encoding_Scheme include support for From_Utf32 and To_Utf32

* Unicode: http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/Unicode3.0.html

* DOM: Finish implementation for the few remaining cases

* XML says that entity *references* appearing in attribute values, like this:
        <FOO bar="this is a &baz; value">
  must be internal: "baz" has to be an internal parsed entity, not
  an external entity.
  => We must distinguish between internal and external entities

* SAX: Should have a feature to specify whether entity refs in attribute
  values should be expanded or not

* SAX: Should we report the same attribute twice for a given element, or
  should this be simplified ?

* Finite state automaton: Should allow for non-deterministic automata, and
  have a function to automatically convert them to a deterministic automaton.
  Of course, this makes debugging much more difficult...

* Parser: Maybe we could add to the error message when we are re-entering
  the main loop to parse entity values (like "while parsing the value of...")

* Parser: Error message are not really clear when we are parsing an entity.
