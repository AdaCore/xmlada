New features in version 4.2
---------------------------

NF-42-K708-021 Schema: Improved multi-tasking support (2011-07-26)

   It is now possible to parse an XSD file once, and then use it for
   several parsers in different threads.

NF-42-K429-012 Schema: Ignore unsupported schema elements (2011-08-16)

   It is now possible to ignore unsupported elements from a XSD file
   (<key>, <keyref>, <field> and <selector>) rather than receive a fatal
   error. This is activated through a call to Set_Feature, see
   schema-schema_readers.ads

NF-42-J818-003 New input source for streaming sockets (2010-12-16)

   A new package was contributed by a user as an example on how to handle
   streaming input, as opposed to reading the whole input at once.
