--  Root package for the Sax hierarchy.
--
--  This hierarchy provides a set of tagged types that can be inherited from
--  so as to implement your own callback functions for parsing a XML document.
--
--  The interfaces in this package are as close as possible from the ones
--  defined in SAX2 (minus the obsolete ones, which have been omitted).
--  See http://www.megginson.com/SAX/ for more information
