--  This package provides smart pointers, ie types that encapsulate a
--  standard pointer and provide automatic memory management for it.

with Ada.Finalization;

package Sax.Pointers is
   --  All types that can be encapsulated in a smart pointer must derive from
   --  a common ancestor, which adds a Refcount field to them. The advantage is
   --  that we require one less memory allocation *per pointer*, since
   --  encapsulating any type requires that the pointer is defined as
   --     type Pointed_Data is record
   --        Data     : access Encapsulated;
   --        Refcount : Natural := 1;
   --     end record;
   --     type Pointer is new Ada.Finalization.Controlled with record
   --        Data     : access Pointed_Data;
   --     end record;
   --  and the association with the refcount is less tight
   --
   --  On the other hand, the implementation chosen in this package requires
   --  the encapsulated type to be slightly bigger, since it includes the tag.
   --  But on the whole, memory usage is the same, with one less alloc/free, so
   --  more efficient.

      --  Data is adopted by the smart pointer, and should no longer be
      --  referenced directly elsewhere. This is meant for efficiency in cases
      --  where copying the data would cost too much.
      --  Typical code looks like:
      --      Tmp := new Encapsulated;
      --      Ptr := Allocate (Tmp);
