KP-43-M325-034 Schema: default attributes not set

  Problem:    When the schema defines optional attributes with default values
              for an element, those attributes are not returned by the parser
              if they were not specified in the XML document.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.4.0

  Workaround: None.
