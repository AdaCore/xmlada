The following is a listing of known problems in release 3.2.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 3.2 technology. This means they are corrected in any 3.3.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-32-IC10-021 Incorrect validation of "date" types with timezone

  Problem:    If an attribute is of type xsd:date, it should allow the use of
              timezones (either "Z" or "+00:00" for instance). XML/Ada does not
              support these in 3.2.0 version

  Status:     Fixed in 3.3.0

  Workaround: You could have two elements, one for the date the other for the
              timezone, although that's not as elegant

KP-32-J302-043 Lots of fixes in schema validation

  Problem:    Several problems were found in the schema validation testsuite.
              These include:
              - Incorrect checking of date ranges (valid days in the month for
                instance), or in time (seconds < 60);
              - Elements with no type should have processContents lax, rather
                than strict. This means that their children element should be
                checked if they have entries in the schema, rather than just
                ignored;
              - Attributes "use" and "fixed" were ignored for attribute whose
                type was defined with a "ref". For instance:
                    <xsd:attribute ref="tn:number" use="required"/>
                Furthermore, when using ref, the referenced attribute's fixed
                was also ignored.
              - Unicity was not checked for types derived from ID. In
                particular, XML/Ada did not check unicity for elements (only
                for certain cases of attributes)
              - HexBinary length must be even
              - In XSD 1.0, elements must have at most one ID attribute. This
                restriction was lifted in XSD 1.1 (and XML/Ada now handles both
                cases)
              - In XSD 1.0, schemaLocation cannot be used after an element has
                already used that namespace
              - Regexp are always anchored implicitly ("^..$"), and "\w" should
                not match "_"
              - Namespaces specified as ##other should not allow unqualified
                elements.
              - Fix computation of length on lists, and therefore the facets
                minLength, length and maxLength
              - Fix handling of anyAttribute when defined in an attributeGroup
              - When multiple anyAttributes are defined for an element, they
                must all match

  Status:     Fixed in 3.3.0

  Workaround: None
