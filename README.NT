Before building this library on Windows, please read the general README !

Windows Specifics
-----------------

1. Due to the nature of GNU Make you need to have a UNIX-type shell and
   utilities installed to build this library. If you do not have this,
   you can download an excellent set at:

      http://www.weihenstephan.de/~syring/win32/UnxUtils.html

   Strongly recommended! Especially if you are an Emacs user...

2. Run 'configure' to generate the makefile.
   An example copy is provided as Makefile.nt, rename it to makefile if you
   cannot run configure

3. Before building make sure to set the following values in 'Makefile':

      export WIN32=TRUE

   to tell the makefile we are building on windows and:

      PREFIX=C:/GNAT/XMLada

   to tell the makefile where to install the library. Note the slashes
   in the path!

4. The best way to proceed is to do a 'make' then 'make install'.

5. If you have GNAT 3.14 or later, you can register the library as an
   standard library using the 'gnatreg' command.

success!
