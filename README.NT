Before building this library on Windows, please read the general README !

Windows Specifics
-----------------

1. Due to the nature of GNU Make you need to have a UNIX-type shell and
   utilities installed to build this library. If you do not have this,
   you can download a set at:

      http://www.weihenstephan.de/~syring/win32/UnxUtils.html

2. Run 'configure' to generate the makefile.
   An example copy is provided as Makefile.nt, rename it to makefile if you
   cannot run configure. You also need to rename Makefile.module.nt to
   Makefile.module

3. Before building make sure to set the following values in 'Makefile':

      PREFIX=C:/GNAT/XMLada

   the makefile where to install the library. Note the slashes in the path!

4. The best way to proceed is to do a 'make install'.

5. If you have GNAT 3.14 or later, you can register the library as a
   standard library using the 'gnatreg' command.

success!
