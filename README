INSTALLING THIS LIBRARY
=======================

Edit the file Makefile in the root directory, and change the variable
PREFIX at the top to reflect the intended location for the library.

If you are using GNAT version 3.13p or lower, uncomment the second
COMPILER line in the file Makefile.module, so that it only contains
"gnatmake". The other switches are not supported in these versions.

type:
   >  make install
to build and install the library.

Files will be copied into ${PREFIX}/lib and ${PREFIX}/include/xmlada.

To use this library, add the following arguments to the gnatmake
command line:
   -aI${PREFIX}/include/xmlada -largs -L${PREFIX}/lib -lxml


CONTENTS OF THE LIBRARY
=======================

The sources in this library are split into several subdirectories, each
with its own README, sources, documentation and unit tests.

The list of subdirectories (aka modules) is:

- state_machine:
  provides a generic state machine, that can be instantiated to transition on
  any type of event

- unicode:
  provides a full support for Unicode and Utf8/Utf16/Utf32 encodings. It also
  support other encodings like Latin1, Latin2, ...

- input_sources
  provides types to read characters from several types of media.

- sax
  Provides a common, standard interface for any XML parser, through
  callback subprograms. You can extend any of the tagged types defined in these
  package and thus parse XML files without having to store a XML tree in
  memory.
  This package is compatible with SAX 2.0, but doesn't implement the functions
  specific to SAX 1.0

- dom
  The Document Object Model is a set of standard subprograms to manipulate
  XML tree in memory.
  Only the Core module is currently implemented.

- docs
  This contains the full documentation for this XML library
