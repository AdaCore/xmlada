INSTALLING THIS LIBRARY ON UNIX
===============================

If you are using GNAT version 3.13 or lower, swap the two COMPILER
lines in the file Makefile.module, so that it only contains
"gnatmake". The other switches are not supported in these versions.

You will need to modify the lines
    GNATMAKE= gnatmake
    CC= gcc
if you are using a compiler other than native GNAT. For instance, if 
you are using a cross-compiler for powerpc/vxworks, you would set them
to
    GNATMAKE= powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gnatmake
    CC= powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gcc


Make sure that you do not have a previous installation of XML/Ada in one
of the directories given in ADA_OBJECTS_PATH, or some files will not be
properly recompiled.

type:
   >  ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX>
   >  make install
to build and install the library.

Files will be copied into ${PREFIX}/lib and ${PREFIX}/include/xmlada.

To use this library, add the following arguments to the gnatmake
command line:
   -aI${PREFIX}/include/xmlada -largs -L${PREFIX}/lib -lxmlada

Alternatively, a script is provided in ${PREFIX}/bin, that outputs all
the command line arguments. You should compile with:
   gnatmake test.adb `xmlada-config`

You can also build a static version of your program by using:
   gnatmake test.adb `xmlada-config --static`

To run a command compiled with this library, you might need to edit the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that ${PREFIX}/lib is included.

Note that this library will not compile with GNU make 3.77 on some platforms,
due to a bug in the handling of the wildcard command. It is recommended that
you update to at least 3.78

TESTING THE LIBRARY
===================

You need to download the official OASIS test suite for XML,
from www.xml.org. The name of the current archive is
     xmlconf-19990712.tar.Z.

Uncompress it somewhere on your disk, then edit the file dom/test/testsuite to
reflect the location of that testsuite (BASE should point to the directory
containing these official tests)

Execute the file
    make test
    cd dom/test
    ./testsuite

This will report the number of errors found.


CONTENTS OF THE LIBRARY
=======================

The sources in this library are split into several subdirectories, each
with its own README, sources, documentation and unit tests.

The list of subdirectories (aka modules) is:

- unicode:
  provides a full support for Unicode and Utf8/Utf16/Utf32 encodings. It also
  support other encodings like Latin1, Latin2, ...

- input_sources
  provides types to read characters from several types of media.

- sax
  Provides a common, standard interface for any XML parser, through
  callback subprograms. You can extend any of the tagged types defined in these
  package and thus parse XML files without having to store a XML tree in
  memory.
  This package is compatible with SAX 2.0, but doesn't implement the functions
  specific to SAX 1.0

- dom
  The Document Object Model is a set of standard subprograms to manipulate
  XML tree in memory.
  Only the Core module is currently implemented.

- docs
  This contains the full documentation for this XML library

 exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
 executable file  might be covered by the  GNU Public License."

BUG REPORTS
===========

Please send questions and bug reports to report@gnat.com following
the same procedures used to submit reports with the GNAT toolset itself.
