New features in version 0.8

- Some file names were shorten in the unicode module, for compatibility with
  VMS systems. See the Perl script unicode/convert.pl for the exact list.

- tree_readers.ads renamed to dom-readers.ads
  This way, only the XML/Ada namespace is used, without conflicts with files
  that may come from the user's code.

- Builds are now based on GNAT project files
  Users of GNAT 3.15 and later will now use GNAT project files to build the
  library, which is easier to configure.

- More efficient parser
  The API in the unicode module has been changed to avoid functions returning
  unconstrained types, resulting in a much faster parser.

- Independence from GNAT
  XML/Ada should now be compilable with other compilers. The GNAT-specific
  packages and attributes have been replaced by equivalents.

- Better support for encodings
  XML/Ada now has a better auto-detection of the encoding (for Utf16 and Utf8
  documents, even when they don't have a Byte-Order-Mark).
  It will also fully process the "<?xml encoding=...?>" declaration at the
  beginning of the documents. The following encodings are currently supported:
    UTF-8
    UTF-16
    ISO-8859-1    LATIN-1
    ISO-8859-2    LATIN-2
    ISO-8859-3
    ISO-8859-4

- Memory leaks fixed

New features in version 0.6

- Parser twice as fast
  The SAX parser has been completely rewritten, and is now about twice
  as fast as the previous one.

- Support for validation (partial)
  A partial support for validation has been added. This means that some of
  the validity constraints defined in the XML specifications are now tested
  (root element type, tests on attributes, ...).
  However, XML/Ada still doesn't test that the XML document matches its DTD.

- New licence
  This library is now distributed under the GNAT-Modified GPL.
