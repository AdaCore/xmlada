New features in version 0.8

- Better support for encodings
  XML/Ada now has a better auto-detection of the encoding (for Utf16 and Utf8
  documents, even when they don't have a Byte-Order-Mark).
  It will also fully process the "<?xml encoding=...?>" declaration at the
  beginning of the documents. The following encodings are currently supported:
    UTF-8
    UTF-16
    ISO-8859-1    LATIN-1
    ISO-8859-2    LATIN-2
    ISO-8859-3
    ISO-8859-4

New features in version 0.6

- Parser twice as fast
  The SAX parser has been completely rewritten, and is now about twice
  as fast as the previous one.

- Support for validation (partial)
  A partial support for validation has been added. This means that some of
  the validity constraints defined in the XML specifications are now tested
  (root element type, tests on attributes, ...).
  However, XML/Ada still doesn't test that the XML document matches its DTD.

- New licence
  This library is now distributed under the GNAT-Modified GPL.
