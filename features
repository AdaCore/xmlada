New features in version 0.6

- Parser twice as fast
  The SAX parser has been completely rewritten, and is now about twice
  as fast as the previous one.

- Support for validation (partial)
  A partial support for validation has been added. This means that some of
  the validity constraints defined in the XML specifications are now tested
  (root element type, tests on attributes, ...).
  However, XML/Ada still doesn't test that the XML document matches its DTD.

- New licence
  This library is now distributed under the GNAT-Modified GPL.
