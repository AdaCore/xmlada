NF-440-LB01-017 attributeGroup support in simple type extensions (2012-11-08)

   It is now possible to extend a simple type in a XSD file, and define which
   attributes are valid in the extension through a <attributeGroup> tag.
   Previously, the attributes had to be specified one by one through the
   <attribute> tag.
