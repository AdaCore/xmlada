KP-42-K518-020 Heap exhausted when validating <all> element

  Problem:    The implementation of the state machine for <all> nodes was
              generating states for all possible combinations of the children
              of <all>. In many cases, this resulted in huge state machines
              and heap exhaustion.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.3.0

  Workaround: None.
