The following is a listing of known problems in release 4.2.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 4.0 technology. This means they are corrected in any 4.3.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-42-L103-011 Schema: missing check for valid attribute types

  Problem:    When an attribute is defined as using an unknown simple type
              (for instance xsd:natural), no error is reported.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.3.0

  Workaround: Check the grammar with an external tool first. Once the grammar
              is correct, XML/Ada will correctly handle it.

KP-42-KC09-030 Project files not found on x86_64-linux

  Problem:    When installing on a 64bit linux platform, the projects
              files are copied into the wrong directory and cannot be found
              automatically by the compiler.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.3.0

  Workaround: Either set the GPR_PROJECT_PATH environment variable, or
              manually copy the project files from prefix/lib64/gnat/ to
              prefix/lib/gnat/.

KP-42-K518-020 Heap exhausted when validating <all> element

  Problem:    The implementation of the state machine for <all> nodes was
              generating states for all possible combinations of the children
              of <all>. In many cases, this resulted in huge state machines
              and heap exhaustion.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.3.0

  Workaround: None.
