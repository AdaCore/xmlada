  --  test: msData/schema/schZ012_a.xsd
  --  Disable because it relies on case-sensitive file systems to work
  --  properly. It fails on Darwin (lena) with HFS and on Windows, since
  --  the included file schZ012_A.xsd is found on those systems.
  --  See discussion at http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=4137

MS-Regex2006-07-15 / reZ001 / reZ001.v
  --  The regexp pattern obviously matches the attribute value, as confirmed
  --  by using Perl

MS-SimpleType2006-07-15 / stE054 / stE054.i
  --  Disabled because "1.0" and "1" are both the same xsd:double value.
  --  Seems the test should validate. According to 4.2.1 in the datatypes
  --  standard, equality is checked in terms of value space, not strings.
