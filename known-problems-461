The following is a listing of known problems in release 4.6.1. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 17.0 technology. This means they are corrected in any 17.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-461-P616-033 Schema: sequences with unbounded elements

  Problem:    When a sequence contains two or more elements with an unbounded
              number of occurrences, as in:
                 <sequence>
                    <element name="a" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                    <element name="b" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                 </sequence>
              then XML/Ada would allow any number of a, then any number of b,
              as expected, but would then allow this sequence to repeat for
              ever.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-06-16

  Workaround: None.
