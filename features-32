NF-32-I702-017 Improved error msg when element repeated too much (2009-07-25)

   If your schema requires a sequence of "a", then "b", and your XML file
   contains "<a><a><b>", XML/Ada used to complain on the second occurrence
   of "a" that at least one occurrence of "b" is expected. The error message
   has now been improved to indicate "Too many occurrences of a".

NF-32-I123-005 Support for windows-1251 encoding (2009-01-23)

   XML files can now be encoded with windows-1251.
