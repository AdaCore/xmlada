KP-441-MB20-045 DOM: Clone_Node does not do deep cloning

  Problem:    Calling Clone_Node to do a deep cloning only clones the node
              itself, but the children are still referencing the old tree,
              and are not cloned.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.4.2 on 2013-11-21

  Workaround: Do the cloning in user code by iterating over the tree.
