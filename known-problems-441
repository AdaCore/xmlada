The following is a listing of known problems in release 4.4.1. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 4.5 technology. This means they are corrected in any 4.5.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-441-N409-003 Input: BOM not skipped for string input

  Problem:    When loading XML data from an in-memory string, and the string
              contains a Byte-Order-Mark, the latter is not properly skipped,
              resulting in a parsing error.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.4.2 on 2014-04-09

  Workaround: Remove the BOM from the string you pass to the parser, and call
              Set_Encoding explicitly instead.

KP-441-N109-044 SAX: Constraint_Error when using Sax.Readers.Reader

  Problem:    The API in recent versions of XML/Ada has changed slightly to
              improve efficiency, and a new type Sax.Readers.Sax_Reader was
              introduced, replacing Sax.Readers.Reader. However, the latter
              is still provided, but using it in your own application might
              result in a Constraint_Error during the parsing, when creating
              the list of attributes.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.4.2 on 2014-01-10

  Workaround: Extend the type Sax_Reader rather than Reader.

KP-441-MB20-045 DOM: Clone_Node does not do deep cloning

  Problem:    Calling Clone_Node to do a deep cloning only clones the node
              itself, but the children are still referencing the old tree,
              and are not cloned.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.4.2 on 2013-11-21

  Workaround: Do the cloning in user code by iterating over the tree.
