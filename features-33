New features in version 3.3
---------------------------

NF-33-J302-043 New exception XML_Not_Implemented (2010-03-24)

   A new exception is raised when using a schema (.xsd) validator, and
   the schema uses features that are not supported by XML/Ada.
   Unsupported features are: xsd:key elements, IDREF and IDREFS types.
   It is also possible to explicitly disable support for some features
   to make sure the subset of Schema you use is fully supported by
   XML/Ada and passes all relevant tests of the W3C testsuite

NF-33-J302-043 Support for the CVS version of W3C testsuite (2010-03-25)

   The W3C committee has reviewed the status of some of their schema
   tests since their last release. Support was added to use this latest
   version. See the README file for information on the setup.
