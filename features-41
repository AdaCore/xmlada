New features in version 4.1
---------------------------

NF-41-JB09-020 Support for XML 1.0 (Fifth Edition) (2010-11-09)

   XML/Ada now support the fifth edition of XML 1.0 (but you can still
   chose to use earlier versions). The differences mostly have to do with
   the range of characters allowed for names. This change was needed to
   run the most recent version of the W3C XML testsuite.

NF-41-J302-043 Rewrite schema validation module (2010-11-05)

   The schema validation module was almost fully rewritten. It is now
   based on a finite-state machine (which changes dynamically if you use
   features such as xsi:type to override types in your XML documents).
   This results in slightly better performances, better results in the
   W3C testsuite (where, given a valid XSD file, we have 100% correct
   results when checking the validity of XML files), and much more
   readable code.
