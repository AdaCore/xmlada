XML/Ada NEW FEATURES LIST
=========================

Copyright (C) 2001-2009, AdaCore

This file contains a list of new features introduced in GPS.
A full description of all GPS features can be found in the GPS
documentation.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the
description line. This date shows the implementation date
of the feature.

New features in version 3.1
---------------------------

 Unicode:
  - H523-017 Add support for the windows-1251 encoding.

 Schema validation:
  - H212-023 The default value of elements is properly taken into account
    when validating the contents of the node. A SAX event is also generated
    for the default value, so that users automatically get access to the
    default value (the latter is also included in the resulting DOM tree
    when using Schema.Dom_Readers)

 Installation
  - HA21-023 prefix/lib no longer contains unversioned .so files, since this
    prevents the use of static libraries on some systems if the user has
    prefix/lib in his LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Instead, only the .so.<version> are
    copied into that directory, since they are enough to run the executables
    linked dynamically with XML/Ada

New features in version 3.0
===========================

 WARNING: the version number of XML/Ada was bumped to 3.x because the API
 has changed slightly in several packages, providing reference-counted types
 and thus automatic memory management. This was necessary to fix some meory
 leaks that couldn't be fix as easily otherwise.

 Input_Sources:
  - G718-020 http input now uses http 1.0 instead of http 1.1, since the
    latter is not always properly understood by servers, and we do not need
    new features from newer versions anyway

 Schema validation:
  - G404-019 fixed handling of use='required' in schemas
  - G425-003 schema-date_time.ads now contains subprograms to convert to
    standard Ada time representation
  - G510-017 API change: ref-counted grammar
    The XML_Grammar type is now reference-counted, and memory management is
    taken care of automatically. This is a change of API, since the Free
    subprogram no longer exists and doesn't need to be called by the user in
    any case.
  - GA01-010 Validation of mixed content for a complex type or an extension
    with no child nodes

 SAX:
  - API change: sax.locators is now ref-counted
    The types in Sax.Locators are now reference-counted, and memory management
    is taken care of automatically. This affects the primitive operation
    Set_Document_Locator of the SAX parser.
    Unfortunately, the memory leaks could not easily be resolved without
    breaking the API here. The changes are minor, but might affect user code,
    removing all needs for calling Ref/Unref

 DOM:
  - FA12-014, G508-017 DOM.Core.Write: new subprogram
    It outputs a Node, based on Ada95 streams.
    This provides additional capabilities over DOM.Core.Print, for instance
    output to sockets or memory without going through a file on disk.
    See also the new example dom/tests/tostring.adb
  - G522-006 Support for pretty-printing in the output
    When a DOM tree is output, an extra parameter was added to Write to
    control the pretty-printing (ie special handling of whitespaces and
    newline character to hopefully make the output more readable to humans)

New features in version 2.3
===========================

 Schema validation:
  - Add support for parsing several .xsd files before parsing an XML file.
    This was possible before but might have resulted in errors about multiply
    defined elements and types
  - Attribute's value normalization is now done based on the value of their
    whitespace facet.

New features in version 2.2
===========================

 Unicode:
  - Properties of characters are now stored in tables, instead of computed
    through tests. This is more efficient
  - Support for new encodings: "ascii" and "utf8"

 SAX parser:
  - We now pass the newer version of the XML Conformance Testsuite
  - Better compatibility with valgrind: no error message is issued by valgrind.
    There were false warnings, but might make it harder to use valgrind on
    your own application.

 DOM:
  - DOM.Core.Documents.Get_Element_By_Id is now implemented
  - Partial port to DOM 3.0

 Schema validation:
  - Added support for base64Binary type

New features in version 2.1
===========================

 Unicode:
  - E930-022 Added support for windows-1252 encoding

 SAX parser:
  - E912-011 No longer use an exception internally to report the end of stream

 DOM:
  - DOM.Core.Nodes.Print now uses the <../> syntax to represent empty nodes
  - EB02-005 DOM.Core.Nodes.Print now prints the namespace declarations

 Schema validation:
  - E802-003 Added support for time-related types, like dateTime, time, date,..
  - Added support for totalDigits and fractionDigits facets for integer types
  - Added support for all missing simple types: anyURI, hexBinary, double, ...
  - Improve support for arbitrary precision types like decimal and integer
  - Add support for using an attributeGroup reference when defining a local
    type for an element

 Documentation:
  - More code examples
  - Describe the syntax to use for XML Schemas

New features in version 2.0
===========================

- Initial support for schema validation is now provided.

- Documentation is now provided in PDF format

- Enhanced documentation; examples of use are now provided

- D507-011: Dom.Core.Nodes.Print can now output real newline characters

- DA04-015: Dom.Core.Nodes.Print can now output with different character set
  or encoding scheme

- D719-001: Dom.Core.Nodes.Print will now output the <?xml?> PI when outputing
  a document

- D714-002: Comments are now properly stored in the DOM tree

- Sax.Locators are now reference-counted, so that they can be preserved across
  calls to Parse.

- D609-022 Shared strings in DOM tree, to reduce memory usage by up to 50%

- Improve location reports in SAX events. In particular, check
  debug_readers.adb
  on how to get the context of an entity expansion if you want even better
  locations.

- CB14-002 Add support for SAX's Entity_Resolver

- A new input source is now provided: Http
  See testxml.adb for an example of use

- A project file is now installed by default (xmlada.gpr) to facilitate the
  use of XML/Ada

- Better integration with GtkAda: A special SAX reader is provided that can
  generate an XML tree in the format expected by Glib.XML
