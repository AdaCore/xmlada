New features in version 17.0
----------------------------

NF-17-P812-015 schema: large values of maxOccurs (2016-08-16)

  Values of maxOccurs larger than 300 previously resulted in an XML validation
  error. This is instead a limitation of XML/Ada, so this has now been changed
  to a warning (we still recommend using "unbounded" to limit the size of the
  state machine, but XML/Ada will now try to build that machine and use the XSD
  nonetheless).

NF-17-P406-028 unicode names from the Unicode 8 standard (2016-06-02)

   The unicode-names-* packages were updated to match the Unicode 8 standard.
   The new bindings are generated via a new importer, which fixes a number of
   issues with the previous bindings:
      - some characters were put in the wrong block (and thus wrong package)
      - some typos due to incorrect parsing of the Unicode files
      - some name aliases would hide canonical names occurring later (for
        instance 1F5E2 was hidden by 1F48B)
      - some unofficial aliases were used (Bell is not long valid, for
        instance)
   This change is not fully backward compatible, due to changes in the Unicode
   standard itself, since some blocks were renamed, as well as some
   characters.

NF-17-OB19-014 new function Schema.Dom_Treader.Current_Node (2015-11-19)

   This function makes it easier to override primitives like Start_Element
   to add custom attributes to elements
