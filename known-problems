Problems in 2.0.1:

- Validating a not well-formed document results in an validation error instead
  of a well-formedness error. It is therefore harder to understand such error
  messages

Problems in 2.0:

- E307-011: Invalid project file for xmlada_schema.gpr when installing static
  libraries

Problems fixed in 2.0

- DB25-005 Incorrect value returned by DOM.Attributes.Owner_Element
- D714-002 Attribute quotes are no longer present in a processing-instruction
  data, in SAX or DOM
- Constraint_Error raised when an external entity doesn't reference an
  existing file
- D213-012: Constraint_Error when using the same parser twice
- SAX: End_Document() is called even in case of a fatal error
- DOM: There is now initially a single Text node per block of text, as required
  by DOM specifications
- DOM: Missing function DOM.Core.Nodes.Node_Type added
- CC01-006: In some cases, the handling of entities like &amp; results in
  duplicates when getting the Node_Value through DOM
- CC01-002: Handling of big files (multi-mega bytes) was generating a
  Storage_Error in Direct_IO.
