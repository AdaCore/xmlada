Problems fixed in 0.8

- Parameter entities used to defined element models no longer have
  to be encapsulated in parenthesis (e.g  "A|B" is a valid value for %ent,
  which can be used in a content model as "(%ent;)").
- URI were incorrectly reported for attributes with namespace.
- URI are correctly resolved for attributes even if the xmlns:... is 
  found after the attribute (but in the same element start tag)
- Some random failures on some systems. Patch sent by J.C. Groult
- Error when an external DTD wasn't found. An Assert_Failure was raised
- Bug in handling of DTD models, for attributes with default values.
  Patch sent by S. Doiel
- Constraint_Error when validating a document that contained invalid
  attributes. Patch sent by S. Doiel

- Library renamed to libxmlada
  The previous name was libxml, which was too general and interfered
  with other libraries like the C libxml
  Problem reported by Jurgen Pfeifer

- Build procedures didn't work on NT
  Due to the UNIX-oriented Makefile, the build procedures didn't work
  correctly on NT and required a lot of adaptation.
