Problems fixed in 1.x

- DOM: There is now initially a single Text node per block of text, as required
  by DOM specifications
- DOM: Missing function DOM.Core.Nodes.Node_Type added
- CC01-006: In some cases, the handling of entities like &amp; results in
  duplicates when getting the Node_Value through DOM
- CC01-002: Handling of big files (multi-mega bytes) was generating a
  Storage_Error in Direct_IO.

Problems fixed in 1.0

- SAX: Ignorable_Whitespace is now only called when there are only spaces
  between two tags. If there is at least a letter, the spaces are concatenated
  and the Character callback is called with the resulting string.
  This is more conform to the SAX specifications, even if the old behavior
  was valid.

- DOM: adding attributes to element other than the root element resulted
  in a Constraint_Error.
- Parameter entities used to defined element models no longer have
  to be encapsulated in parenthesis (e.g  "A|B" is a valid value for %ent,
  which can be used in a content model as "(%ent;)").
- URI were incorrectly reported for attributes with namespace.
- URI are correctly resolved for attributes even if the xmlns:... is 
  found after the attribute (but in the same element start tag)
- Some random failures on some systems. Patch sent by J.C. Groult
- Error when an external DTD wasn't found. An Assert_Failure was raised
- Bug in handling of DTD models, for attributes with default values.
  Patch sent by S. Doiel
- Constraint_Error when validating a document that contained invalid
  attributes. Patch sent by S. Doiel

Problems fixed in 0.7

- Dom.Core.Nodes.Normalize now processes the full subtree, as it should.

- Several memory leaks fixed (all of them, according to gnatmem)

Problems fixed in 0.6

- Library renamed to libxmlada
  The previous name was libxml, which was too general and interfered
  with other libraries like the C libxml
  Problem reported by Jurgen Pfeifer

- Build procedures didn't work on NT
  Due to the UNIX-oriented Makefile, the build procedures didn't work
  correctly on NT and required a lot of adaptation.

- Installation was missing some files
  Some of the source files, like encodings.ads, were not copied to the
  installation directory.

- Several parser problems fixed
