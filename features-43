Compatibility with previous releases

Schema.Dom_Readers.Free no longer frees the DOM tree (see the known-problems

New features in version 4.3
---------------------------

NF-43-KC20-003 License updated to GPL3 (2011-12-20)

   The license for XML/Ada Pro is now GPL3 with the standard exception
   allowing the creation of proprietary software.

NF-43-KC07-033 Documentation converted to Sphinx (2011-12-08)

   The documentation was converted to another format, providing nicer
   looking output. It also adds support for searching in the documentation.

NF-43-KC01-026 Schema: Ignore unsupported xsd:unique (2011-12-01)

   In the 4.2 version, we added support for silently ignoring some
   schema constructs rather than receive a fatal error. This has been
   extended to <xsd:unique> elements.
