New features in version 4.4
---------------------------

NF-44-N411-012 New subprograms Import_Node and Adopt_Node (2014-05-06)

   These subprograms, part of respectively DOM level 2 and DOM level 3,
   are now implemented, and can be used to move or copy one node from a
   tree to another. In addition, subprograms like Append_Child will now
   correctly complain when the new node was not created for the same tree.

NF-44-N324-002 New configure option --enable-build (2014-03-24)

   This switch improves compatibility with other AdaCore addons like GtkAda.
   It enables one to choose the default build mode (Debug or Production)
   at configure line, rather than through environment variables.

NF-44-MA08-027 Expose utf8 functions in unicode-ces-utf8.ads (2013-10-08)

   Some specialized UTF8 functions were added to this package, which can
   therefore be used in more contexts that just XML/Ada

NF-44-M916-017 Allow relative URI in namespace location (2013-09-17)

   For compatibility with older XML documents, XML/Ada can now be set up
   to allow relative URI when declaration namespaces. This needs to be
   activated through Sax.Allow_Relative_IRI_Feature.

NF-44-M805-006 Tree_Reader gives access to the current node (2013-08-21)

   The package DOM.Readers gives access to the DOM node that is being created.
   This allows users to more easily extend the Tree_Reader object to add their
   own processing, like creating custom attributes.

NF-44-LB01-017 attributeGroup support in simple type extensions (2012-11-08)

   It is now possible to extend a simple type in a XSD file, and define which
   attributes are valid in the extension through a <attributeGroup> tag.
   Previously, the attributes had to be specified one by one through the
   <attribute> tag.
