KP-40-JA21-015 xmlada-config --cflags not compatible with gcc

  Problem:    "xmlada-config --cflags" outputs path information with -aI.
              This switch is only understood by gnatmake, not by gcc.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.1.0

  Workaround: Edit the shell script xmlada-config and replace -aI with -I
