KP-41-K704-031 Handling of large "double" numbers

  Problem:    When comparing double numbers (minInclusive, maxInclusive,
              enumerations,...) XML/Ada will fail to handle numbers outside of
              Ada's Long_Long_Float range, although XML allows them.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.2.0

  Workaround: None.
