KP-45-O508-012 Remove GPS plug-in

  Problem:    XML/Ada comes with its own GPS plug-in to make the
              documentation available in that environment. But GPS now also
              provides that doc out of the box, so this resulted in a
              duplication.

  Status:     Fixed in XML/Ada 4.6.0 on 2015-05-11

  Workaround: Disable the xmlada-gps.py plugin in GPS.
