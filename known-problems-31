The following is a listing of known problems in release 3.1.0. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 3.2 technology. This means they are corrected in any 3.2.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in
the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has the fix
identified in the entry.

KP-31-IA09-001 Reuse of SAX parser after an error is not possible

  Problem:    The SAX parser uses an internal buffer while parsing. When an
              error occurs, the buffer is properly freed, but an index is not
              reset. As a result, reusing the same parser to parse another
              file is not possible.

  Status:     Fixed in 3.2.0

  Workaround: Create a new parser for every file you need to parse.

KP-31-I910-014 Cannot compile with a cross-compiler

  Problem:    The configure script checks that a C compiler is available and
              results in applications that can be run on the host. This is
              not true when using a cross-compiler

  Status:     Fixed in 3.2.0

  Workaround: Set the CC environment variable to a native compiler, it is
              not used anyway when compiling XML/Ada

KP-31-I727-025 Comparison of arbitrary precision numbers ending with ".000"

  Problem:    When your schema file includes a "decimal" type and specifies
              some minimal and maximal values, XML/Ada incorrectly compares
              the value in the XML file and the schema file if one of them
              ends with ".0" and not the other.

  Status:     Fixed in 3.2.0

  Workaround: Always specify ".0" even when specifying an integer number

KP-31-I723-028 Handling of <xsd:appinfo>

  Problem:    If you grammar file contains an appinfo, this element can contain
              any XML node. However, XML/Ada rejects such a content

  Status:     Fixed in 3.2.0

  Workaround: filter out the contents of appinfo before feeding it to
              XML/Ada. The contents do not play any role in actual validation

KP-31-I702-002 (Schema): validating fixed attributes

  Problem:    If an attribute is declared as "fixed" in the schema, this
              indicates that only a specific value can be used for it in the
              XML file. However, XML/Ada did not properly enforce it.

  Status:     Fixed in 3.2.0

  Workaround: This impacts validation only, not the parsing of the file. No
              workaround found

KP-31-I212-047 Installation problem with shared libraries

  Problem:    When installing the shared libraries, XML/Ada did not create
              some of the links (libname.so.{MAJOR})

  Status:     Fixed in 3.2.0

  Workaround: Create the missing links manually
